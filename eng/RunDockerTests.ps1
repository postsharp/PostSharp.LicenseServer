.SYNOPSIS
    Runs the Docker-based tests that apply to one platform, and reports each of them to TeamCity.

.DESCRIPTION
    A Docker-based test is a test that needs a container of its own. Each test is a directory containing a
    manifest (test.psd1) and an entry point (RunTest.ps1). This script discovers those directories, selects
    the tests whose manifest lists the current platform, runs them one at a time, and reports the result of
    each one.

    The only requirements on the host are PowerShell 7.5 and a container engine whose operating system and
    processor architecture match the platform. The tool chain under test lives in the test's own image, so
    this script never needs the .NET SDK, MSBuild or Visual Studio.

    A test reports its own result through its exit code alone. This script owns the TeamCity protocol, so a
    test stays runnable by hand.

.PARAMETER Path
    The directory containing the test directories, relative to this script. Defaults to the value the product
    declares, which is what generate-scripts wrote into this file.

.PARAMETER Platform
    The platform to run: win-x64, win-arm64, linux-x64 or linux-arm64. Defaults to the platform of the
    container engine this host is running.

.PARAMETER Test
    Runs only the test of this name. Without it, every test that applies to the platform is run.

.NOTES
    A test reports its outcome by its exit code: 0 passed, 4 skipped, anything else failed. The skip code is
    for a scenario the test finds it cannot reproduce on this host, which is different from the manifest's Skip:
    that one is known in advance, this one only once the test has looked. A skipping test should write a line
    beginning with 'SKIPPED:', which becomes the reason reported.

.PARAMETER NoTeamCity
    Writes plain text instead of TeamCity service messages. Implied when TEAMCITY_VERSION is not set.

.EXAMPLE
    ./RunDockerTests.ps1 -Platform linux-x64

    ./RunDockerTests.ps1 -Platform win-x64 -Test Issue15-AssetsFileV4
